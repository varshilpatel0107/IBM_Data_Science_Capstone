Applied Data Science Capstone
This capstone project marks the culmination of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization, summarizing the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program into a comprehensive project.

Project Overview
SpaceX has revolutionized commercial space travel by significantly lowering costs. While other providers charge upwards of $165 million per launch, a Falcon 9 rocket launch costs just $62 million, thanks to SpaceX’s ability to reuse the rocket’s first stage. Predicting the success of a first-stage landing can help estimate launch costs. This project uses publicly available data and machine learning models to determine the likelihood of reusing the first stage.

Key Questions
How do factors such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit type influence the success of first-stage landings?
Has the success rate of first-stage landings improved over time?
What is the most effective algorithm for binary classification in this case?
